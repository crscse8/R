#What proportion of the sample reports being in excellent health? 4,657

#Show how many participants have smoked across each gender

#Show a mosaic plot of the above table

#Exercise 3
#What does the mosaic plot reveal about smoking habits and gender? More males have smoked at least 100 cigarettes.

#Show weights for all respondents

#or this can do the same:

#Show weight for 567th respondent
cdc$weight[567]

#Show weight for the first ten respondents

#These formulas produce a True/False value for every respondent
cdc$gender == "m"
cdc$age > 30

#Create male respondent subset

#Show first 6 rows of mdata
head(mdata)

#Show subset of men who are over 30 years of age
m_and_over30 <- subset(cdc, gender == "m" & age > 30)

#Show subset of men or respondents who are over 30 years of age
m_or_over30 <- subset(cdc, gender == "m" | age > 30)

#Exercise 4
#Create a new object called under23_and_smoke that contains all observations of respondents under the age of 23 that have smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. 
under23_and_smoke <- subset(cdc, smoke100 == "1"& age < 23)

#Boxplot for height
boxplot(cdc$height)

#Show summary stats
summary(cdc$height)

#Compare heights of men and women 
boxplot(cdc$height ~ cdc$gender)

#For each of the 20,000 participants, we take their weight, divide by their height-squared and then multiply by 703. The result is 20,000 BMI values
bmi <- (cdc$weight / cdc$height^2) * 703
boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$genhlth)

#Exercise 5
#What does this box plot show? It shows that respondents who identify with fair or poor general health have a higher BMI.
#Pick another categorical variable from the data set and see how it relates to BMI. List the variable you chose, why you might think it would have a relationship to BMI, and indicate what the figure seems to suggest.
#There is an association between a higher BMI and a lower rate of exercise, so I decided to compare those two variables. The resulting plot suggests that respondents who do not exercise have a higher BMI.
boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$exerany)

#Show histrogram for respondent age
hist(cdc$age)

#Show histogram with breaks
hist(bmi)
hist(bmi, breaks = 50)

#How do these two histograms compare? The histogram with the breaks shows a more accurate depiction of the data

#On Your Own
#1.  Make a scatterplot of weight versus desired weight. Describe the relationship between these two variables.
#The majority of respondents are their desired weight or are close to their desired weight.
plot(cdc$weight ~ cdc$wtdesire)

#2. Let’s consider a new variable: the difference between desired weight (wtdesire) and current weight (weight). Create this new variable by subtracting the two columns in the data frame and assigning them to a new object called wdiff.
wdiff <- cdc$weight - cdc$wtdesire
wdiff

#3.What type of data is wdiff? It's a numerical value that shows the difference in pounds(lbs) between a respondent's current weight and the desired weight
#If an observation wdiff is 0, what does this mean about the person’s weight and desired weight?  It means their current weight also happens to be their desired weight - no weight to lose or gain.
#What if wdiff is positive or negative?  A negative value means it's weight a respondent needs to gain, and a positive number indicates the weight a respondent would need to lose. 

#4. Describe the distribution of wdiff in terms of its center, shape, and spread, including any plots you use. 
plot(cdc$weight ~ cdc$wtdesire)

#The center hovers between 100 and 200lbs. The shape has a sharp arrow effect, pointed downward, with an emphasis on the lower 100lbs.  The spread is narrow which suggests respondents have similar ideas when it comes to desired weight. 
#What does this tell us about how people feel about their current weight?
#The plot shows that the majority of respondents want to decrease their current weight.
hist(cdc$weight, breaks = 50)
hist(cdc$wtdesire, breaks = 50)

#5.  Using numerical summaries and a side-by-side box plot, determine if men tend to view their weight differently than women.
#x equals a weight difference greater than zero, which means weight a respondent wants to lose.
x <- wdiff > 0

#Number of male respondents who want to lose weight
summary(x & cdc$gender == "m")

#Number of female respondents who want to lose weight
summary(x & cdc$gender == "f")

#5,248 men want to lose weight - 26.24%
#7,516 women want to lose weight - 37.58%
#A higher percentage of female respondents are not satisfied with their weight
boxplot(wdiff ~ cdc$gender)

#6. Find the mean and standard deviation of weight and determine what proportion of the weights are within one standard deviation of the mean.
#The mean of weight is 169.683
mean(cdc$weight)

#The standard deviation of weight is 40.08097
sd( cdc$weight)

#209.764 = 1 standard deviation of the mean
#Need to determine number of people who fall between 169 and 209.764
s <- cdc$weight == 169 | cdc$weight <= 209.764
table(s)
16935 / 20000
#84.675% of weights are within one standard deviation of the mean.
