#Start with a simple random sample of size 60 from the population and a focus on the size of the house, represented by the variable Gr.Liv.Area.

population <- ames$Gr.Liv.Area
samp <- sample(population, 60)

#Exercise 1  Describe the distribution of your sample. What would you say is the “typical” size within your sample? Also state precisely what you interpreted “typical” to mean.

hist(samp)

#The distribution is bimodal and right skewed. 

#A typical size falls between 1,000 and 1,500 sq ft., the values between the two bimodal peaks - which is how I would interpret typical.

#Exercise 2 Would you expect another student’s distribution to be identical to yours? Would you expect it to be similar? Why or why not?

#I would expect for another student's distribution to be very similar.  The sample size is over 30, so it should be relatively close in nature. 

#Calculate the mean of the sample

sample_mean <- mean(samp)

#Calculate 95% confidence interval

se <- sd(samp) / sqrt(60)
lower <- sample_mean - 1.96 * se
upper <- sample_mean + 1.96 * se
c(lower, upper)

#[1] 1376.816 1653.618

#This is an important inference that we’ve just made: even though we don’t know what the full population looks like, we’re 95% confident that the true average size of houses in Ames lies between the values lower and upper. 

#Exercise 3 For the confidence interval to be valid, the sample mean must be normally distributed and have standard error. What conditions must be met for this to be true?

#Confidence intervals try to estimate a population parameter.  The sample has to be completely random, and the sampling distribution of the sample proportion should have a normal distribution - this assumption can be made with the following rule of thumb: per sample, more than 10 successes and more than 10 failures each.  The other condition is the 10% rule, also called the independence condition, which means the sample size should be less than 10% of the population.

#Exercise 4 What does “95% confidence” mean? 

#The standard error (SE) represents the standard deviation associated with the estimate, and roughly 95% of the time the estimate will be within 2 SE of the parameter. If the interval spreads out 2 standard errors from the point estimate, we can be roughly 95% confident that we have captured the true parameter.

#Calculate true population mean

mean(population)

#Exercise 5 Does your confidence interval capture the true average size of houses in Ames? If you are working on this lab in a classroom, does your neighbor’s interval capture this value?

#The mean is 1499.69 and this value is captured in the confidence interval.  I am a remote student so the second questions is N/A.

#Exercise 6 Each student in your class should have gotten a slightly different confidence interval. What proportion of those intervals would you expect to capture the true population mean? Why? If you are working in this lab in a classroom, collect data on the intervals created by other students in the class and calculate the proportion of intervals that capture the true population mean.

#I would expect that if each student is using a 95% confidence level, then the majority of intervals (90%+) should include the true population mean. I'm not in a classroom so this part of the question is N/A.

#Create empty vectors where we can save the means and standard deviations that will be calculated from each sample. And store the desired sample size as n.

samp_mean <- rep(NA, 50)
samp_sd <- rep(NA, 50)
n <- 60

#Create loop where we calculate the means and standard deviations of 50 random samples.

for(i in 1:50){
  samp <- sample(population, n) # obtain a sample of size n = 60 from the population
  samp_mean[i] <- mean(samp)    # save sample mean in ith element of samp_mean
  samp_sd[i] <- sd(samp)        # save sample sd in ith element of samp_sd
}

#Construct the confidence intervals:

lower_vector <- samp_mean - 1.96 * samp_sd / sqrt(n) 
upper_vector <- samp_mean + 1.96 * samp_sd / sqrt(n)

#Lower bounds of these 50 confidence intervals are stored in lower_vector, and the upper bounds are in upper_vector. Let’s view the first interval.

c(lower_vector[1], upper_vector[1])

#On Your Own:

#1.  What proportion of your confidence intervals include the true population mean? Is this proportion exactly equal to the confidence level? 

plot_ci(lower_vector, upper_vector, mean(population))

#Based on the plot, only 3 confidence intervals do not contain the true population mean, so that means 47/50 (94%) contain the true population mean (1499.6904).  This proportion is not exactly equal to the 95% confidence level, but we're dealing with estimates so no outcome can be precise.  Also, I noticed that each time I ran the code, the plot outcomes changed.

#2. Pick a confidence level of your choosing, provided it is not 95%. What is the appropriate critical value?

#I choose 98% confidence level, z-value is 2.33

#3. Calculate 50 confidence intervals at the confidence level you chose in the previous question.  Using the plot_ci function, plot all intervals and calculate the proportion of intervals that include the true population mean. How does this percentage compare to the confidence level selected for the intervals?

lower_vector2 <- samp_mean - 2.33 * samp_sd / sqrt(n) 
upper_vector2 <- samp_mean + 2.33 * samp_sd / sqrt(n)
c(lower_vector2[1], upper_vector2[1])
plot_ci(lower_vector2, upper_vector2, mean(population))

#At the time that I ran the code, all confidence intervals (100%) contained the true population mean (1499.6904).
